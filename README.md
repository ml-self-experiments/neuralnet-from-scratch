# neuralnet-from-scratch

This is a modularized implementation of full scale neural network from scratch.
This project enables users to add their own cost functions and optimizations functions as simple as possible.
This is my first step towards exploring the inner working of neural networks and in coming projects i would like to write code from scratch of CNNS, RNNS, R-CNNs, etc. 
I believe if we can tweek the inner mathematics of these powerful algorithms we can harness their actual power.
